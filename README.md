Question 1: 

To calculate the acquisition cost for each target we divided the Contact cost by the response rate. The results (Appendix Table 1) shows that the Elite ballplayers (party) is the group with the highest acquisition cost and the Entertainment Seekers is the one with low loyalty.The frequency with which the players use the services or the center and the amount of money they spend in the club are the main reasons why Elite Ball players (party) is the most important target group for the company.

Question 2: 

In the Appendix (Table 2), there are results or the profits per year and the break-even point. To calculate profit the acquisition cost minus annual margin was used for the first year and then we applied the retention rate. For the break-even point, the sum of acquisition cost and annual margin was added for the first year and profits were added for each year. This provides information about when the profits overcome the precious costs per target group. The result shows that the Entertainment seekers is the group which has a positive outcome before the end of first year. The majority of the groups need a bit less than 3 years, meanwhile Elite ball players (Ad) is the target which reaches the break-even point before the end of the 4th year. 

Question 3: 

CLV for each segment was calculated using the following formula: 
The segment with the highest CLV is the Elite Ball players targeted with the party. They have a value of () when subtracting their acquisition cost and a lifetime of 11 years . 

Question 4: 

We suggest that the most attractive customer segment is the Elite ball players (Party). That is because they have the highest Customer Lifetime Value of all segments. They bring a lot of revenue and compensate for the big investments. However, since they are not a large group, MBC needs other segments too, such as Little Leagues to cover the costs and take advantage of the facilities for the rest of the hours. 

Question 5 - 7: 

Calculating the new CLV after the price discount and the increase in the retention rate, the loss in the revenue is compensated by the higher retention rate. The lifetime of Elite ball players increases by 4 years. 

# Conclusion 

Price promotion would benefit the company, as long as it leads to greater CLV, so MBC should offer the discount.
